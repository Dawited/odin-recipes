    <h1>Peach Tart</h1>
    <p>
        This creamy no-bake peach tart has a very light, peachy filling, and a lovely toasted almond press-in graham cracker crust. Use the best quality, ripest peaches you can find for optimal flavor. Give yourself plenty of time to make thisâ€”it requires at least 6 hours to chill.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>9 graham crackers</li>   
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li> Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom with a round of parchment paper. Lightly grease pan and paper. </li>
            <li>Prepare the crust: place graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs form. </li>
            <li>Place almonds in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until almonds are toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour almonds into the food processor bowl with the graham crumbs. Pulse until combined. </li>
            <li>Melt butter in the skillet using the residual heat of the pan, or if needed, place pan over low heat just until butter is melted. Add butter and honey to the food processor bowl, and pulse until mixture is thoroughly combined. </li>
            <li>Pour crust mixture into prepared tart pan. Press crust firmly and evenly into the bottom and up sides of the pan. Place tart pan on a small baking sheet or cutting board, then freeze until crust is firm, at least 15 minutes. </li>
            <li>For filling, place gelatin and cold water in a saucepan; let stand for 5 minutes to allow gelatin to bloom. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add peaches, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, Greek yogurt, and heavy cream to the jar of a high-powered blender. Blend mixture until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste, and add more sugar or lemon juice, if needed; then blend again to combine. </li>
            <li>Place saucepan with gelatin over low heat; cook, stirring constantly, until gelatin dissolves, 1 to 3 minutes. With the blender running on low speed, carefully pour gelatin mixture into peach mixture. Gradually turn blender speed up to High and blend for 30 seconds. </li>
            <li>Remove tart crust from the freezer. Carefully pour peach mixture into the tart crust, only filling to the lip of the crust. You will have extra peach filling. Place extra filling into a ramekin or small dessert bowl and refrigerate until set; and enjoy as a separate dessert once fully chilled. </li>
            <li>Refrigerate tart, uncovered, for at least 6 hours to overnight to set. </li>
            <li>When ready to serve, remove tart from pan and remove parchment paper. If desired, top tart with sliced peaches and blueberries just before serving. </li>
            <li><strong>ENJOY!!!</strong></li>
        </ol>
